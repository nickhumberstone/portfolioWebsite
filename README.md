Portfolio Website [https://humberstone.uk](https://humberstone.uk)

2. Project Description
My portfolio website is a place for me to share my work, let people find out more about me, and allow people to get in touch with me. It also allows me to easily create additional pages for other uses, such as a login splash screen for [Retrospect](https://github.com/nickhumberstone/retrospect-client) - the social journalling app that I've developed.

It's built with React and Next.JS, and hosted with Vercel, and available on my custom domain.
This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

The current focus of this project is to increase my success in applying for jobs, but in future I hope to make it more generally about myself, have links to a number of interesting side projects, and add a markdown blog where I can post articles about the overlap of tech, politics, democracy, and AI.

3. How to Install and Run the Project
If you want to run a version of this locally, you can clone the repo using

```bash
git clone https://link
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

4. License (to be added later)
   Will likely be a GPL license, allowing full rights to modify. I need to visit https://choosealicense.com/

Additional notes:
Inspiration for a redevelopment: https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/ZxXbeP

I also want to implement some kind of scroll lock so the mobile experience is nicer.
